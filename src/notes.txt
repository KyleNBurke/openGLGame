Material
	- StandardMaterial
		unaffected by lights
		- color
	- LambertMaterial
		color is calculated using ambient and diffuse
		- diffuse color
	- PhongMaterial
		color is calculated using ambient, diffuse and specular
		- diffuse color
		- specular color
	- NormalMaterial
		- color is calcuated using the normal vectors


What do we need to draw a mesh?
- vertex attributes -> geometry
- shader -> material
- translation -> object3D

How three js works:
- The standard material just gives the mesh a color uneffected by lights
- The lambert material uses the Lambertian model (ambient + diffuse) with the gouraud interpolation technique (per vertex)
- The phong material uses the Phong model (ambient + diffuse + specular) with the phone interpolation technique (per pixel)

So we could implement these three reflectance models and have the option to use flat, gourand or phong interpolation
